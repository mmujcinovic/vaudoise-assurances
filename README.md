# Technical exercise ‚Äì Vaudoise Assurances
## Description
REST API for managing clients (Person / Company) and their contracts.
## Architecture & Design
The project follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

‚Ä¢ **Controller layer**  
Handles HTTP requests and responses. It exposes only the necessary endpoints and delegates all logic to services.

‚Ä¢ **Service layer**  
Contains the business rules: client creation, contract lifecycle, automatic endDate updates, soft deletion, and cost aggregation. It ensures validation and consistency.

‚Ä¢ **Repository layer**  
Uses Spring Data JPA to manage persistence transparently, with custom queries when needed (e.g. active contracts, sums).

**DTO/Record models** are used to isolate API input/output from entities. Validation is handled with annotations and service checks.

**Soft delete** is applied on clients by using an `active` flag and closing contracts instead of removing data.

The business logic prevents operations on inactive clients to ensure data integrity. For example, creating a contract for a deactivated client returns a functional error. This approach guarantees consistency and preserves the relationship with existing contracts.

Two profiles are available:

‚Ä¢ `h2` (file-based, no setup)

‚Ä¢ `postgres` (via Docker)

This structure ensures maintainability, testability, and clean responsibility boundaries.
## Prerequisites
üîπ Java 17 or higher - is required to run the application.  
üîπ Maven Wrapper - is included ine the project (`./mvnw` or `mvnw.cmd`).  
üîπ All commands below were tested using Windows Command Prompt (cmd).
## Running the application
### Clone the repository (required for all options)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the project.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmujcinovic/vaudoise-assurances.git
```
2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate into the project directory.
```bash
cd vaudoise-assurances
```
### ‚ñ∂ Option 1 ‚Äî H2 profile (default, no installation required)
Runs the application using the embedded in-memory H2 database.
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
### ‚ñ∂ Option 2 ‚Äî Docker (PostgreSQL profile)
üîπ Prerequisite: Docker must be installed on your machine (Docker Desktop or equivalent).  
  
Run the application using a PostgreSQL database in Docker.  
  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Start the PostgreSQL container.
```bash
docker compose up -d db
```
2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the application with the postgres profile.
```bash
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=postgres
```
